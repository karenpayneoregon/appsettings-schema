Shows how to create a populate an appsetting.json file.

The idea is that a developer when creating a custom appsettings.json file its not done in an application, instead do this in a console project and work out any kinks as a configuration file becomes complex as in this [article](https://dev.to/karenpayneoregon/storing-and-reading-values-from-appsettingsjson-io) it will be difficult to figure out why something is not working.

Next step is writng unit test against the configuration file.
